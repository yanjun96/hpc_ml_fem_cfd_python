This is a repository for personal practice about

1: High performance computing, including GPU, MPI slides and codes

2: Finite element method, foucs on variational form and error analysis

3: Computational fluid dynamics, derive N-S equations, and finite volume method

4: Computational python, books and codes, introduce various tool, such as MAKE, Regular Expression, Numpy, etc.

5: C++. books and codes
