We can split the text into individual chunks, and then map these chunks to numerical tokens -- collectively this is the process of [tokenization](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tokenizer_summary). Numerical tokens can then be fed into a language model.\n",

    "2. **Character-based tokenization**: splits text into individual characters. While this involves a very small vocabulary, it produces long sequences and loses word-level meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subword tokenization**: breaks words into smaller units (subwords) based on their frequency. The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n",

By training the model further on a carefully curated dataset, we can modify its behavior, style, or capabilities. Fine-tuning is used in a variety of applications, not just language modeling. But in language modeling, fine-tuning can be used to:\n",

    "\n",
    "While benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the performance of language models on a variety of tasks, these benchmarks are not always representative of the real-world performance of the model. For example, a model may perform well on a benchmark but poorly on a more realistic task. Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model. Synthetic data generation and synthetic tasks are a way to address these limitations, and this is an active area of research.\n",

    "We can also turn a qualitative evaluation of a generated response quantitative by deploying someone or something to \"judge\" the outputs. In this lab, we will use a technique called [LLM as a judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) to do exactly this. This involves using a larger LLM to score the outputs of a smaller LLM. The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing."

    "Great! We have set up our judge LLM, but we still need to make this quantitative. We can do this by defining a metric that uses the judge LLM to score the outputs of the model. Doing this is streamlined with Comet ML's [Opik library](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/python-sdk-reference/), a platform for LLM evaluation and benchmarking.\n",

If not, you can sign up for a Comet account [here](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm&utm_source=mit_dl&utm_medium=notebook&utm_campaign=opik) if you have not done so already. Now we will use the Comet Opik library to define a metric that uses the judge LLM to score the outputs of the model.\n",

    "Opik has a base class for defining metrics, [`base_metric.BaseMetric`](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/python-sdk-reference/evaluation/metrics/BaseMetric.html). You will use this to define a custom metric that uses the judge LLM to evaluate text for how well it adheres to Yoda speak. Note that the judge LLM and the metric can be applied to any text, not just the outputs of the model. This is important to keep in mind, since we need both a negative control -- text in the \"base\" standard English style -- and a positive control -- training-set text in Yoda-speak style -- against which to compare the model's generations.\n",

At the end of this lab, you will evaluate the likelihood of a held-out test-sample of true Yoda-speak under your chat model. Include this likelihood in your report. This gives us a quantitative measure to compare different chat models (which may have interacted with different judge LLMs).\n",
